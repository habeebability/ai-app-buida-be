## 🚀 **API FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED**

### ✅ **All Endpoints Working Correctly**

1. **Health Check** - ✅ Working
   ```bash
   GET /health → 200 OK
   ```

2. **Authentication** - ✅ Working with Security
   ```bash
   POST /api/auth/login → Properly rejecting invalid attempts
   POST /api/auth/register → Input validation working
   ```

3. **Input Validation** - ✅ Working
   - Detected XSS attempts in firstName field
   - Detected SQL injection patterns
   - Proper error responses with validation details

4. **Security Logging** - ✅ Working
   - Failed login attempts logged
   - Suspicious patterns detected and logged
   - Comprehensive security event tracking
